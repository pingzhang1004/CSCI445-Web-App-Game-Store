1.In the traditional model, the form's action specifies what happens when the submit button is pressed. How does the sample code connect the submit button to jQuery? (i.e., what line(s) of code do this).

In the traditional model, without AJAX, the form's action attribute specifies the URL to which the form data is sent when the submit button is pressed. The method (GET, POST, etc.) by which the data is sent is determined by the method attribute of the form.
For example, consider a simple form:
<form action="ajaxsubmit.php" method="post">
    <!-- form fields here -->
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

Using jQuery code connects the submit button.This line listens for a click event on the element with the ID "submit" (which is likely the submit button) and then executes the function provided when that event occurs.
$("#submit").click(function(){
    ...
});



2.What PHP file will be executed on the server?
The PHP file that will be executed on the server is:ajaxsubmit.php


3.How does this code collect data from the form to pass to the server/php?
The form data is collected using jQuery methods to fetch the input values and then formatted as a data string, which is subsequently passed to the PHP server script through the AJAX request.The code collects data from the form to pass to the server/PHP using the following steps:
(1)It first fetches the values entered in the form fields using jQuery's .val() method:
var name = $("#name").val();
var email = $("#email").val();
var password = $("#password").val();
var contact = $("#contact").val();
(2)Then, it constructs a data string (datastring) that concatenates the form field values into a format suitable for submission:
var datastring = 'name1='+ name + '&email1='+ email + '&password1='+ password + '&contact1='+ contact;
(3)This datastring is then passed to the server via the AJAX request in the data property:
$.ajax({
    ...
    data: datastring,
    ...
});


4. What line of JavaScript code is executed in the callback function?
The line of JavaScript code that is executed in the callback function is:

alert(result);

This line displays an alert box with the response result returned from the server after the AJAX request has been processed.


5. How does the PHP function provide the value to be displayed in the callback function? (i.e., what line of code "returns" the message that is displayed).
The PHP function provides the value to be displayed in the callback function with the line of code:

echo "Form Submitted Successfully";

This line "returns" the message "Form Submitted Successfully" as the response to the AJAX request, which is then picked up by the JavaScript callback function and displayed using the alert(result); statement.
